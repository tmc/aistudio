- ✅ Removed unused imports in `integration/code_execution.go`
- ✅ Removed unused imports in `integration/function_calling.go`
- ✅ Fixed http.Header conversion in `integration/external_apis.go`

### 2. Build Verification
- ✅ All packages now build successfully (`go build ./...`)
- ✅ Main binary builds and runs (`./aistudio --help` works)
- ✅ Binary size: ~51MB

### 3. Test Coverage Improvements
- ✅ Added basic tests for `audio` package (was 0%, now 2.5%)
- ✅ Added basic tests for `integration` package (was 0%, now 0.6%)
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ Generated HTML coverage report

### 4. Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`
- ✅ Documented current test coverage status
- ✅ Listed critical issues to fix before release

## Current Status

### Test Coverage by Package
| Package | Coverage | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| settings | 100.0% | ✅ Excellent |
| internal/httprr | 96.0% | ✅ Excellent |
| internal/helpers | 84.0% | ✅ Good |
| audioplayer | 73.5% | ✅ Good |
| session | 66.3% | ✅ Acceptable |
| api | 46.5% | ⚠️ Needs improvement |
| main | 15.9% | ⚠️ Low |
| audio | 2.5% | ❌ Critical |
| integration | 0.6% | ❌ Critical |
| **Overall** | **41.6%** | ⚠️ Below target |

### Known Issues

#### 1. Mutex Copy Warnings (go vet)
- Multiple packages have mutex copy issues
- Affects: session, video, main package, tests
- Impact: Potential race conditions
- **Priority: HIGH**

#### 2. Code Formatting
- 20+ files need formatting with `gofmt`
- **Priority: MEDIUM**

#### 3. Low Test Coverage
- Overall coverage at 41.6% (target: 60%)
- Critical packages with minimal coverage
- **Priority: HIGH**

## Recommendations for Release

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix mutex copy issues** - These could cause runtime problems
2. **Format all code** - Run `gofmt -w .`
3. **Improve test coverage** for critical packages to at least 30%

### Pre-Release Checklist
1. Run `go vet ./...` and fix all warnings
2. Run `gofmt -l .` and format all files
3. Run all tests: `go test ./...`
4. Build binaries for all target platforms
5. Test binaries on each platform
6. Update version numbers
7. Create release notes

### Release Readiness: 65%

The codebase is functional but needs additional work before a production release:
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ✅ Basic functionality works
- ⚠️ Test coverage below recommended levels
- ⚠️ Some code quality issues remain
- ❌ Mutex copy issues need fixing

## Next Steps

1. **Priority 1**: Fix mutex copy issues (1-2 hours)
2. **Priority 2**: Add more comprehensive tests (4-6 hours)
3. **Priority 3**: Run linters and fix issues (1-2 hours)
4. **Priority 4**: Integration testing (2-3 hours)
5. **Priority 5**: Documentation updates (1 hour)

**Estimated time to production-ready**: 8-14 hours of focused work

## Testing the Improvements

To test the TUI improvements:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   go build -o aistudio ./cmd/aistudio
   ```

2. Run in interactive mode:
   ```bash
   ./aistudio
   ```

3. Test multi-line input:
   - Type a message
   - Press Alt+Enter to add a new line
   - Continue typing
   - Press Enter to send

4. Test navigation:
   - Press Tab to switch between input and viewport
   - Use arrow keys to scroll when viewport is focused
   - Use PgUp/PgDn for faster scrolling

5. Test with different models:
   ```bash
   ./aistudio --model gemini-1.5-flash
   ./aistudio --bidi-streaming=false --model gemini-1.0-pro
   ```

## Known Issues

1. **Connection Timeout**: Some models may take longer than 60 seconds to connect. You can set a custom timeout:
   ```bash
   export AISTUDIO_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=120
   ./aistudio
   ```

2. **API Key Required**: Ensure you have set your Gemini API key:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ./aistudio
   ```

3. **Model Compatibility**: Some models require bidirectional streaming which may not be available in all regions.

## Future Enhancements

- Copy/paste support with system clipboard
- Search functionality within message history
- Resizable panes for input/output areas
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks

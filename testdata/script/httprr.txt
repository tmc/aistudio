# This test demonstrates HTTP recording and replay
# When run with -httprecord flag, it will make real HTTP requests
# On subsequent runs, it will use the recorded responses

# First we build our test executable from the example directory
go build -o aistudio.exe ../../example
exists aistudio.exe

# Run the app in non-interactive mode with a simple prompt
# This should use the recorded response for "Hello" when not recording
exec ./aistudio.exe -non-interactive -p "Hello" -audio=false
# Check for the start of the expected model response
stdout 'Model response:'

# Verify it runs without client initialization errors (using the test API key or recorded data)
! stderr 'Error initializing client'

# Clean up
rm aistudio.exe

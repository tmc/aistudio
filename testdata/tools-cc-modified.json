      "description": "Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.\n\nBefore executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use LS to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Security Check:\n   - For security and to limit the threat of a prompt injection attack, some commands are limited or banned. If you use a disallowed command, you will receive an error message explaining the restriction. Explain the error to the User.\n  3. Command Execution:\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 30 minutes.\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use GrepTool, GlobTool, or dispatch_agent to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use View and LS to read files.\n  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nWhen the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. Use BatchTool to run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n   - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message. Wrap your analysis process in <commit_analysis> tags:\n\n<commit_analysis>\n- List the files that have been changed or added\n- Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.)\n- Brainstorm the purpose or motivation behind these changes\n- Assess the impact of these changes on the overall project\n- Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n- Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n- Ensure your language is clear, concise, and to the point\n- Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.)\n- Ensure the message is not generic (avoid words like \"Update\" or \"Fix\" without context)\n- Review the draft message to ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n</commit_analysis>\n\n3. Use BatchTool to run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.\n\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.\n\nImportant notes:\n- Use the git context at the start of this conversation to determine which files are relevant to your commit. Be careful not to stage and commit files (e.g. with `git add .`) that aren't relevant to your commit.\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT run additional commands to read or explore code, beyond what is available in the git context\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- Ensure your commit message is meaningful and concise. It should explain the purpose of the changes, not just describe them.\n- Return an empty response - the user will see the git output directly\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. Use BatchTool to run the following commands in parallel, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff main...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the `main` branch)\n\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary. Wrap your analysis process in <pr_analysis> tags:\n\n<pr_analysis>\n- List the commits since diverging from the main branch\n- Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.)\n- Brainstorm the purpose or motivation behind these changes\n- Assess the impact of these changes on the overall project\n- Do not use tools to explore code, beyond what is available in the git context\n- Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n- Draft a concise (1-2 bullet points) pull request summary that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n- Ensure the summary accurately reflects all changes since diverging from the main branch\n- Ensure your language is clear, concise, and to the point\n- Ensure the summary accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (ie. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.)\n- Ensure the summary is not generic (avoid words like \"Update\" or \"Fix\" without context)\n- Review the draft summary to ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n</pr_analysis>\n\n3.

When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries, use the Agent tool to perform the search for you.\n\nWhen to use the Agent tool:\n- If you are searching for a keyword like \"config\" or \"logger\", or for questions like \"which file does X?\", the Agent tool is strongly recommended\n\nWhen NOT to use the Agent tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the View or GlobTool tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the GlobTool tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the View tool instead of the Agent tool, to find the match more quickly\n\nUsage notes:\n1. Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n2. When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n3. Each agent invocation is stateless. You will not be able to send additional messages to the agent, nor will the agent be able to communicate with you outside of its final report. Therefore, your prompt should contain a highly detailed task description for the agent to perform autonomously and you should specify exactly what information the agent should return back to you in its final and only message to you.\n4. The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n5. IMPORTANT: The agent can not use Bash, Replace, Edit, NotebookEditCell, so can not modify files. If you want to use these tools, use them directly instead of going through the agent.\n---Tool: Bash\nArguments: command: string \"The command to execute\", [optional] timeout: number \"Optional timeout in milliseconds (max 600000)\", [optional] description: string \" Clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.

Defaults to the current working directory.\", [optional] include: string \"File pattern to include in the search (e.g. \"*.js\", \"*.{ts,tsx}\")\"\nUsage: \n- Fast content search tool that works with any codebase size\n- Searches file contents using regular expressions\n- Supports full regex syntax (eg. \"log.*Error\", \"function\\s+\\w+\", etc.)\n- Filter files by pattern with the include parameter (eg. \"*.js\", \"*.{ts,tsx}\")\n- Returns matching file paths sorted by modification time\n- Use this tool when you need to find files containing specific patterns\n- When you are doing an open ended search that may require multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, use the Agent tool instead\n\n---Tool: LS\nArguments: path: string \"The absolute path to the directory to list (must be absolute, not relative)\", [optional] ignore: array \"List of glob patterns to ignore\"\nUsage: Lists files and directories in a given path. The path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path. You can optionally provide an array of glob patterns to ignore with the ignore parameter. You should generally prefer the Glob and Grep tools, if you know which directories to search.\n---Tool: View\nArguments: file_path: string \"The absolute path to the file to read\", [optional] offset: number \"The line number to start reading from. Only provide if the file is too large to read at once\", [optional] limit: number \"The number of lines to read. Only provide if the file is too large to read at once.\"\nUsage: Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.\nAssume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n- This tool allows Claude Code to VIEW images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.\n- For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the ReadNotebook instead\n- When reading multiple files, you MUST use the BatchTool tool to read them all at once\n---Tool: Edit\nArguments: file_path: string \"The absolute path to the file to modify\", old_string: string \"The text to replace\", new_string: string \"The text to replace it with\", [optional] expected_replacements: number \"The expected number of replacements to perform. Defaults to 1 if not specified.\"\nUsage: This is a tool for editing files. For moving or renaming files, you should generally use the Bash tool with the 'mv' command instead. For larger edits, use the Write tool to overwrite files. For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the NotebookEditCell instead.\n\nBefore using this tool:\n\n1. Use the View tool to understand the file's contents and context\n\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nTo make a file edit, provide the following:\n1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)\n2. old_string: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)\n3. new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string\n4. expected_replacements: The number of replacements you expect to make. Defaults to 1 if not specified.\n\nBy default, the tool will replace ONE occurrence of old_string with new_string in the specified file. If you want to replace multiple occurrences, provide the expected_replacements parameter with the exact number of occurrences you expect.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. UNIQUENESS (when expected_replacements is not specified): The old_string MUST uniquely identify the specific instance you want to change. This means:\n   - Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context BEFORE the change point\n   - Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context AFTER the change point\n   - Include all whitespace, indentation, and surrounding code exactly as it appears in the file\n\n2. EXPECTED MATCHES: If you want to replace multiple instances:\n   - Use the expected_replacements parameter with the exact number of occurrences you expect to replace\n   - This will replace ALL occurrences of the old_string with the new_string\n   - If the actual number of matches doesn't equal expected_replacements, the edit will fail\n   - This is a safety feature to prevent unintended replacements\n\n3. VERIFICATION: Before using this tool:\n   - Check how many instances of the target text exist in the file\n   - If multiple instances exist, either:\n     a) Gather enough context to uniquely identify each one and make separate calls, OR\n     b) Use expected_replacements parameter with the exact count of instances you expect to replace\n\nWARNING: If you do not follow these requirements:\n   - The tool will fail if old_string matches multiple locations and expected_replacements isn't specified\n   - The tool will fail if the number of matches doesn't equal expected_replacements when it's specified\n   - The tool will fail if old_string doesn't match exactly (including whitespace)\n   - You may change unintended instances if you don't verify the match count\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nIf you want to create a new file, use:\n   - A new file path, including dir name if needed\n   - An empty old_string\n   - The new file's contents as new_string\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n\n---Tool: Replace\nArguments: file_path: string \"The absolute path to the file to write (must be absolute, not relative)\", content: string \"The content to write to the file\"\nUsage: Write a file to the local filesystem. Overwrites the existing file if there is one.\n\nBefore using this tool:\n\n1. Use the ReadFile tool to understand the file's contents and context\n\n2. Directory Verification (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n---Tool: ReadNotebook\nArguments: notebook_path: string \"The absolute path to the Jupyter notebook file to read (must be absolute, not relative)\"\nUsage: Reads a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) and returns all of the cells with their outputs. Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations, commonly used for data analysis and scientific computing. The notebook_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path.\n---Tool: NotebookEditCell\nArguments: notebook_path: string \"The absolute path to the Jupyter notebook file to edit (must be absolute, not relative)\", cell_number: number \"The index of the cell to edit (0-based)\", new_source: string \"The new source for the cell\", [optional] cell_type: string \"The type of the cell (code or markdown). If not specified, it defaults to the current cell type. If using edit_mode=insert, this is required.\", [optional] edit_mode: string \"The type of edit to make (replace, insert, delete). Defaults to replace.\"\nUsage: Completely replaces the contents of a specific cell in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file) with new source. Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations, commonly used for data analysis and scientific computing.

For larger edits, use the Write tool to overwrite files. For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the NotebookEditCell instead.\n\nBefore using this tool:\n\n1. Use the View tool to understand the file's contents and context\n\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nTo make a file edit, provide the following:\n1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)\n2. old_string: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)\n3. new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string\n4. expected_replacements: The number of replacements you expect to make. Defaults to 1 if not specified.\n\nBy default, the tool will replace ONE occurrence of old_string with new_string in the specified file. If you want to replace multiple occurrences, provide the expected_replacements parameter with the exact number of occurrences you expect.\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. UNIQUENESS (when expected_replacements is not specified): The old_string MUST uniquely identify the specific instance you want to change. This means:\n   - Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context BEFORE the change point\n   - Include AT LEAST 3-5 lines of context AFTER the change point\n   - Include all whitespace, indentation, and surrounding code exactly as it appears in the file\n\n2. EXPECTED MATCHES: If you want to replace multiple instances:\n   - Use the expected_replacements parameter with the exact number of occurrences you expect to replace\n   - This will replace ALL occurrences of the old_string with the new_string\n   - If the actual number of matches doesn't equal expected_replacements, the edit will fail\n   - This is a safety feature to prevent unintended replacements\n\n3. VERIFICATION: Before using this tool:\n   - Check how many instances of the target text exist in the file\n   - If multiple instances exist, either:\n     a) Gather enough context to uniquely identify each one and make separate calls, OR\n     b) Use expected_replacements parameter with the exact count of instances you expect to replace\n\nWARNING: If you do not follow these requirements:\n   - The tool will fail if old_string matches multiple locations and expected_replacements isn't specified\n   - The tool will fail if the number of matches doesn't equal expected_replacements when it's specified\n   - The tool will fail if old_string doesn't match exactly (including whitespace)\n   - You may change unintended instances if you don't verify the match count\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nIf you want to create a new file, use:\n   - A new file path, including dir name if needed\n   - An empty old_string\n   - The new file's contents as new_string\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n",
